# 150. Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation
[Click here](https://leetcode.com/problems/evaluate-reverse-polish-notation/)
### You are given an array of strings tokens that represents an arithmetic expression in a Reverse Polish Notation. Evaluate the expression. Return an integer that represents the value of the expression.

## Note that:

* The valid operators are '+', '-', '*', and '/'.
* Each operand may be an integer or another expression.
* The division between two integers always truncates toward zero.
* There will not be any division by zero.
* The input represents a valid arithmetic expression in a reverse polish notation.
* The answer and all the intermediate calculations can be represented in a 32-bit integer.
 


## Constraints:

### 1 <= tokens.length <= 104
### tokens[i] is either an operator: "+", "-", "*", or "/", or an integer in the range [-200, 200].
